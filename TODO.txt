• The memory of who entered is lost when there's no one in the space, on the deployed version. It's not creating the file where this should be retained. This works fine in my local development, need to see what's wrong.

• The colour of the curtain should be specified in MRE parameters as an RGBA hex string.
• The messages we display the users should be customizable using message files (in the format shown here: https://phrase.com/blog/posts/step-step-guide-javascript-localization/, but server-side).
• Add a readme to explain what this project is about, similar for the one we have for the timer.
